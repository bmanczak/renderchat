# renderchat

> Just show me the conversation.

Given the URL of a ChatGPT, Claude, or Grok shared conversation, `renderchat` extracts the conversation and renders it into copy-paste text for any LLM. There's also a Human view that is much more readable (but way worse than native interface of chatgpt, claude, or grok tbh).

I built this bc I have conversations in chatgpt, claude, or grok that I want to use in other applications (e.g. Cursor) as context.

[Here's](https://www.loom.com/share/acb40d73daa641c5a4beefd2ba81f678?speed=2.5) a 13 second demo of the tool in action ü§ó

## Installation

Install and use easily with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

```bash
uv tool install git+https://github.com/bmanczak/renderchat
```

Or manually:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bmanczak/renderchat
cd renderchat
uv pip install -e .
```

The tool will automatically install Playwright's Firefox browser on first run.

Firefox is used for all platforms (better Cloudflare bypass than Chromium).

## Usage

You get the URL of a conversation by clicking the "Share" button in chatgpt, claude, or grok and then copying the URL.

**ChatGPT:**

```bash
renderchat https://chatgpt.com/share/68f8d065-e1a0-8002-bfad-cd20855d5c8f
```

**Claude:**

```bash
renderchat https://claude.ai/share/a110df84-4c35-4865-8587-e95ed13ae3fb
```

**Grok:**

```bash
renderchat https://grok.com/share/bGVnYWN5_57a569b2-d8d9-43be-b345-b60e756b8c63
```

The tool will:

1. Fetch the shared conversation from ChatGPT, Claude, or Grok
2. Render it into a single static temporary HTML file
3. Automatically open the file in your browser

Once open, you can toggle between two views:

- **üë§ Human View**: Clean, readable conversation with markdown rendering and navigation
- **ü§ñ LLM View**: XML-formatted conversation ready to paste into any LLM

### Saving XML directly

For agentic systems or direct LLM integration, you can save the conversation as XML:

```bash
# Save to default location ({conversation_id}.xml in current directory)
renderchat https://chatgpt.com/share/68f8d065-e1a0-8002-bfad-cd20855d5c8f --save-xml

# Save to custom path
renderchat https://chatgpt.com/share/68f8d065-e1a0-8002-bfad-cd20855d5c8f --save-xml /path/to/conversation.xml

# Save only the last 3 conversation turns (user-assistant pairs)
renderchat https://chatgpt.com/share/68f8d065-e1a0-8002-bfad-cd20855d5c8f --save-xml --last-turns 3
```

**What's a "turn"?** A turn is one user message plus the assistant's response. This is perfect for giving an LLM just the recent context without overwhelming it with the entire conversation history.

This is particularly useful when you want to:

- Programmatically access conversations for LLM context
- Skip the HTML interface and go straight to XML
- Integrate with automated workflows or agents
- Extract only recent interactions for focused LLM analysis
